# workout-tracker
Python project 

Created using **Nutitionix API** and **Sheety generate Google Sheets API** 

1) Create My Workouts Spreadsheet in Google Sheets (For header info look into the params pass in the code)
2) Get API KEY And ID from Nutritionix API website
3) Log into Sheety using the same Gmail account that you used for #2
4) Make sure Sheety has permission to your Google Sheets - create new project and use the Google Sheets url to generate an endpoint via Sheety. Enable GET and POST requests.

Use 1 - 4 to take natural language input and update the date to obtain the required exercise entities to log into Google Sheets. Log the resulting data under the appropriate headers. 
Enjoy!
